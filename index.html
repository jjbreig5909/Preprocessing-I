        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I was drafted in 2018 by the greatest football team in the world, the Buffalo Bills. I had a lot of doubters coming out of college. They said I was <span class="accent">inaccurate</span>. They said it <span class="accent">wasn't possible</span> to throw as hard as I do. They said I <span class="accent">didn't look good in shorts</span>. I proved them all wrong.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, I've gotten the Bills off to a 3-0 start, I've meshed with the city, my accuracy has gone up 15%, and I can throw a football into outer space. Wanna win a Super Bowl? Hire me.</p>
